Things to do:
1. Add Label handling to Assembler. Specifically assign each label with a unique number.
2. Finish LUT inside or outside PC with correct addresses. DONE
3. Finish Jump instructions for Controller (did a little bit of this but unsure if works) DONE
4. Debug architecture
5. Start running program 1
6. ensure compare command works with carry flags

- add logical shift right (LSR) command
- add done command (add done command)
- check operand order is correct for some instructions.
//mov reg4 reg5 move Register 4 into register 5
//cmp reg6 reg0 compares reg6 to reg0
//add stores result in first reg
//and stores result in first reg
//xor stores result in first reg
- maybe redo alu?

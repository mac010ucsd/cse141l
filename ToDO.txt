Things to do:
1. Add Label handling to Assembler
2. Finish LUT inside or outside PC with correct addresses
3. Finish Jump instructions for Controller (did a little bit of this but unsure if works)
4. Debug architecture
5. Start running program 1

- add logical shift right (LSR) command
- add exit command
- add no op (optional depending on how stuff implemented)
- check operand order is correct for some instructions
